<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Started working when I was 16 years old and even before I understood the world of business 
  I knew the computer and code is going to change the way the world will operate.</p>

<p> Always been curious about web design and all the details of the internet but never had the time to learn as I 
  was focusing on the business part of making processes easier.
</p>

<p>Now the adventure in Web Development has started with this project and hopefully it will go to great heights! 
  Wishing myself good luck on this stage of the journey!
