<HR />
<h2> Man of Steel: Superman</h2>
<p> This version of the Superman Story telling is great because the actor is the best cast for the role and her truely looks like the character described in comic books.</p>
<h2> Dark City</h2>
<p> This story tells of how we are caught in the reality that is presented  instead of taking charge and changing the reality to the best of our ability. The human race is made to think and feel accordingly to theyre memories and tested on my aliens for the search of the soul.</p>
<H2> The Mask</H2>
<p> Funny, entertianing and deals for the complex idea of that we are the sum of our emotions and inner thoughts that creates our personality. Deals with the mask that helps the wearer to bring there most inner personality out.</p>
