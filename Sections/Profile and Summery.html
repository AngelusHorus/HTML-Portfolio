    <h2>Summery Statement</h2>
    <p>Each day I try to pursue the truth, live the reality presented, reach for a better future, and try to be genuinely happy.</br>
    During the past fifteen years, I have developed skills and expertise in the retail, sales, and procurement sectors,</br>
    where I designed and automated various business processes.</br>
    This resulted in higher department productivity, and reduced company overheads.</br>
    To succeed in these projects, I had to help the team embrace change by offering guidance, training, and setting an example by diligently adhering to the new processes following the processes we designed.</br>
    During this time, I decided that I want to move away from the operational activities of the retail sector and direct my focus on system and process design and develop a career in Business and Data analysis.
